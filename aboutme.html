  	<h1>About Me</h1>
	  <p> Interests: hanging out with friends, traveling, and I sing and play guitar and have gigs around town</p>
	  <p> Future Plans: I think it would be cool to go to Utah State and be apart of their music program so I can study and improve on my music skills. 
		  or I would study interior design.</p>
